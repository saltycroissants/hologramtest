# hologramtest
unity project for tangible hologram interaction

created as an intern project for VR/AI lab in EWHA womans university

This unity program is meant to be used with leap motion tracker.
When leap sensor tracks motion, there is change in 3D model. The 3D model is then projected at pyramid hologram device.

When using this program with leap motion and pyramid hologram device, users can directly change the shape of hologram through physical motion.

Image below is a snapshot of program when run using Unity.
